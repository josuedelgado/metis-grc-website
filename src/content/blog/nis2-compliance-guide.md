The NIS2 Directive (EU 2022/2555) represents a significant evolution in European cybersecurity regulation. For organizations classified as essential or important entities, compliance is not optional — and the deadlines are approaching fast.

## What is NIS2?

NIS2 is the European Union's updated directive on network and information security. It replaces the original NIS Directive from 2016 and significantly expands the scope of organizations that must comply.

## Who Must Comply?

NIS2 applies to organizations in 18 sectors, divided into essential entities (energy, transport, banking, health, digital infrastructure) and important entities (postal services, waste management, food, manufacturing, digital providers).

## Key Requirements

The directive mandates risk management measures, incident reporting (24h early warning, 72h detailed report, 1 month final report), supply chain security, and governance accountability.

## How Metis GRC Helps
